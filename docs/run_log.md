# Numerical run log

Each run entry records the code revision, configuration, command, runtime, and
validation outcome. Generated meshes, solver logs, and HDF5 output remain local
and ignored by Git; this file stores run metadata and summary metrics only.

## PyLith elastic-cavity toolchain check

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Code revision | `835ec48e073daf42fd331188ed3b2b7e332e0170` |
| Environment | Conda `envs/axial-modeling`; Python 3.12; Gmsh 4.15.2 Python API |
| Solver | PyLith 5.0.2; PETSc 3.25.4 |
| Command | `make smoke` |
| Configuration | `pylith/step00_elastic_cavity/step00.cfg` and `pylithapp.cfg` at the recorded revision |
| Runtime | 4 s |
| Mesh | 2,761 linear tetrahedra; 666 nodes; 40 km × 40 km × 20 km fallback box |
| Result | Maximum vertical surface displacement: 0.364047 m |
| Validation | Passed. Required displacement and Cauchy-stress HDF5 fields were present, and peak uplift was within the 0.01–10 m smoke range. |
| Interpretation | Toolchain and elastic response check only; this is not a calibrated model or reproduced manuscript panel. |

The run's repository configuration is identified by its commit. SHA-256 values

At the same code revision, `make test` passed with four tests and `make lint`
reported no findings.

## OOI bottom-pressure intake

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Code revision | `6de3f2e` |
| Source | OOI public ERDDAP, `BOTSFLU-DAYDEPTH`, Central and Eastern Caldera BOTPT instruments |
| Command | `python data/fetch_bpr.py --start 2014-01-01 --end 2026-10-08 --download` |
| Runtime | 2.2 s |
| Central coverage | 3,955 daily records, 2014-08-31 to 2026-09-30; aggregate QC `NOT_EVALUATED` for all records |
| Eastern coverage | 4,029 daily records, 2014-09-05 to 2026-09-30; aggregate QC `NOT_EVALUATED` for all records |
| Local processing | `python data/process_bpr.py PATH_TO_FILE.csv.gz`; outputs remain under ignored `data/processed/` |
| Relative uplift | By 2026-09-30, +0.660889 m at Central and +0.204590 m at Eastern relative to each instrument's first available daily sample |
| Validation | Both compressed downloads had the expected ERDDAP columns, nonempty data, complete provenance manifests, and matching record counts. QC flags were retained, not treated as passes. |
| Limitation | This OOI daily product already includes tide removal and periodic sensor-drift corrections. It does not cover the 1998 or 2011 eruptions. No datasets supplied with or cited by the paper were used. |

The local manifest records each request URL and the SHA-256 of its uncompressed
ERDDAP response. The observations remain local and are excluded from Git.

## Same-mesh PyLith Maxwell restart check

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Code revision | `80ac3b6` |
| Environment | Conda `envs/axial-modeling`; Python 3.12; Gmsh 4.15.2 Python API |
| Solver | PyLith 5.0.2; PETSc 3.25.4 |
| Command | `make maxwell-restart` |
| Configuration | `pylith/step01_maxwell_restart/step01_single.cfg`, `step01_split.cfg`, and `step01_restart.cfg` |
| Runtime | 18.12 s for mesh generation and three bounded PyLith solves |
| Mesh | 2,761 linear tetrahedra; 666 nodes; same generated box mesh for all runs |
| Result | Restarted run reached 2 s; normalized maximum differences were `1.612e-8` for displacement, stress, and viscous strain and `1.613e-8` for total strain. |
| Validation | Passed. The continuous run and two-segment run agreed below the configured `5e-7` tolerance for all four fields. `make test` passed with 18 tests; `make lint` passed. |
| Interpretation | Verifies same-mesh displacement and linear Maxwell state transfer for constant properties and a fixed 10 MPa cavity load. This is a restart test, not the temperature-dependent or historical model. No paper-supplied or paper-cited BPR records were used. |

The exporter samples displacement at mesh vertices and viscous and total strain
at tetrahedron centroids. The restart reads those values with nearest-point
queries. Cross-mesh interpolation and temperature-dependent material updates
remain unverified.

## Tetrahedral steady heat solver verification

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Code revision | `6445d71` |
| Environment | Conda `envs/axial-modeling`; Python 3.12; SciPy 1.18.1 |
| Command | `make test` and `make lint` |
| Configuration | Synthetic 3 × 3 × 3 nodal cube with 48 linear tetrahedra; boundary values and material properties are test fixtures. |
| Runtime | 0.51 s for 22 tests; Ruff completed successfully. |
| Result | Recovered a linear 10–110 °C profile to `1e-10` °C, the 0.5 °C midpoint for uniform volumetric heating, and a finite converged variable-conductivity solution. |
| Validation | Passed. The linear and source cases match their one-dimensional analytical solutions; boundary temperatures remain prescribed in all cases. |
| Interpretation | Verifies the finite-element operator and Picard iteration only. It does not assign Axial model boundaries or supply a full three-dimensional thermal field. |

## Thermal-to-material-to-mechanics smoke check

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Code revision | `c9e9a7b` |
| Environment | Conda `envs/axial-modeling`; Python 3.12; Gmsh 4.15.2 Python API |
| Solver | PyLith 5.0.2; PETSc 3.25.4 |
| Command | `make thermal-material-smoke` |
| Configuration | `pylith/step01_maxwell_restart/step01_single.cfg` with manufactured affine temperatures, constant thermal conductivity, and a generated cell-centered material database |
| Runtime | 8.16 s for mesh generation, thermal solve, database creation, and the PyLith solve |
| Mesh | 2,761 linear tetrahedra; 666 nodes |
| Result | The finite-element solve matched its affine analytical temperature field to `4.547e-13` °C; PyLith reached 2 s and wrote finite stress and viscous-strain fields, with peak absolute stress `1.68912e7 Pa`. |
| Validation | Passed. The synthetic temperature ranged from 190 to 370 °C; the explicitly supplied modulus varied by depth. `make test` passed with 24 tests, and `make lint` passed. |
| Interpretation | Verifies the synthetic thermal-to-property-to-mechanics data path and cell-centered SimpleDB exchange. Prescribed temperatures cover every boundary, including the cavity, for a manufactured solution; this does not verify Axial boundary conditions or coupled thermal-mechanical feedback. |

## Analytical Mogi reference checks

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Code revision | `0368796` |
| Environment | Conda `envs/axial-modeling`; Python 3.12; NumPy 2.x |
| Command | `make test` and `make lint` |
| Configuration | Synthetic spherical source and elastic moduli; no observation series or published result values. |
| Runtime | 0.46 s for 27 tests; Ruff completed successfully. |
| Result | The implementation returned radial half-space displacement, positive center uplift for inflation, and linear scaling with pressure change. |
| Validation | Passed. Synthetic center uplift matched the closed-form expression; symmetry and pressure-scaling tests passed. |
| Interpretation | Adds an analytical reference function. PyLith mesh convergence against the spherical-source solution remains unverified. |
